This package implements adaptive kernel density estimation algorithms for 1-dimensional 
signals developed by Hideaki Shimazaki. This enables the generation of smoothed histograms
that preserve important density features at multiple scales, as opposed to naive
single-bandwidth kernel density methods that can either over or under smooth density
estimates. These methods are described in Shimazaki's paper:

Three methods are implemented in this package:
1. sshist - can be used to determine the optimal number of histogram bins for independent 
identically distributed samples from an underlying one-dimensional distribution. The
principal here is to minimize the L2 norm of the difference between the histogram and the
underlying distribution.

2. sskernel - implements kernel density estimation with a single globally-optimized 
bandwidth.

3. ssvkernel - implements kernel density estimation with a locally variable bandwidth.
 
Dependencies: These functions in this package depend on NumPy for various operations 
including fast-fourier transforms and histogram generation.
